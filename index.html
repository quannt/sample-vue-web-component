                <h1 class="h1">About The Interaction Design Foundation</h1>
                <p>
                    The Interaction Design Foundation is the world’s most prestigious community and course platform for
                    user
                    experience designers. We’ve spent the last 16 years perfecting our community, courses, and most
                    importantly,
                    our work environment. And we’re never going to stop improving on what we’ve achieved so far!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We offer a 100% remote working environment where you have the freedom to become the best possible
                    version of
                    yourself—in both your professional and private life. But with great power comes great
                    responsibility. The
                    freedom of remote working places a vast responsibility on each of us at the IDF to continuously
                    deliver
                    excellent results, collaborate effectively, prioritize wisely, and improve our skills and
                    performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remote working is not for everyone. But all of us at the IDF who have tried and succeeded with
                    remote
                    working will never go back to regular 9-to-5 work, because there’s nothing quite like the freedom to
                    work in
                    a distraction-free and supportive environment.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2">How we are changing design education</h2>

                <h3 class="h3">Education and Professional Development</h3>
                <p>
                    We offer a unique and extensive library of design-related textbooks and comprehensive instructor-led
                    online courses. Members also acquire hands-on experience through participation in real-life projects
                    and design activities. Nonetheless, the educational process occurs outside of courses, too: members
                    learn from each other via professional discussion forums, through local meet-ups, and by
                    participating in IDF global design events.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3">Development of Leadership Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    IDF members get opportunities to train in various leadership roles. Depending on their preference
                    and abilities, they may guide junior designers, manage projects, volunteer to head a local
                    community, or play a global role at the IDF. For those who need elaborate coaching skills in their
                    work, we provide a comprehensive training course on coaching in the design profession, along with
                    the opportunity to practice by coaching members of the IDF Design League.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3">Contribution to the Profession</h3>
                <p>
                    Proven experts in the field of UX can contribute to the quality of education and professional
                    services by developing training materials and textbooks. We also offer outstanding publishing
                    opportunities with an immediate reach to our million-strong target audience.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3">Hiring and Developing Personnel</h3>
                <p>
                    We help companies, from the smallest to the largest such as SAP and Accenture, to build great
                    customer experiences in the most certain way. The IDF Company Membership enables company managers
                    to:
                </p>

                    <li>Build UX design and research expertise in their companies by taking instructor-led courses at home or at work—these are completely self-paced so as to accommodate busy schedules
