# Welcome to the IDF Front-End Code Challenge!

It is a relatively simple code challenge, which lets us get a sense of your coding style and choices.

The code challenge does not involve any exotic or bleeding-edge technologies, frameworks, etc. and that's the point: We'd like to focus on your code style and not get distracted. 

On that note, we're also not looking for "rights and wrongs", and there are no "trick parts" in this challenge. We would merely like to get a more profound impression of how you write code.

That also allows us to have a more fruitful and constructive discussion at the technical interview.
We're not fans of white-boarding at interviews so we'd much rather have some concrete code to talk about.
We think that makes the interview much more enjoyable and productive. 

That said, we hope you put plenty of efforts into some of the details so that we get a chance
to see you shine â€” despite the simplicity of the challenge. ðŸ¦„


## Your challenge/task
Imagine you're our new front-end ðŸ¦„ and you just got a feature request!

You've just stepped into the middle of a conversation on a Github issue and here is what was said:

Our Designer (feature requester) wrote the following:
> Hey Devs. A fantastic opportunity just came up through a few of our so-called Educational Partners (EPs), which are partner websites.
It would be wonderful if you guys could implement an embeddable widget for IDF's articles that can be used on any of these 3rd party websites.
I've already made a design for you as a [zeplin file](https://zpl.io/2jvlRgq), and you can log in with the credentials:
>  - username: `idf_unicorn`
>  - password: `unicorn`


After 2 hours, a back-end developer said:
> Roger that. I've implemented back-end APIs for both calls:
> - GET https://www.interaction-design.org/widgets/articles?ep=usabilitygeek where `ep` is the slug for the given "ep" (Educational Partner)
> - GET https://www.interaction-design.org/widgets/articles/load-more/the-power-of-white-space?ep=usabilitygeek where `the-power-of-white-space` is the slug of the latest already loaded article.
> Both API endpoints work with CORS simple requests (that do not trigger CORS pre-flight).

...and that was the latest message on that Github issue.

So, your goal is now to implement the front-end part of this feature.


## Have questions or in doubt?

There are no set-in-stone technical requirements for this feature because
neither the designer nor the back-end developer can provide you with such requirements.

You are of course more than welcome to ask questions about this challenge in case you're in doubt about something or need more background information!

## How to submit your solution
Please submit your solution in a git repository.
You can use services like GitHub or Bitbucket.
Ideally, you could make an initial commit with the files of this code challenge and then build your solution upon that.

You can submit your solution in 2 ways:
 1. Use **public** git repository and send us the link.
 2. Use **private** git repository and send us the link (if you don't want to create a public repository for personal reasons).
 In this case, please provide read access for
 the following user: `idf-bot` (valid for [GitHub](https://github.com/idf-bot) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/idf-bot/)).

Hint: both GitHub and Bitbucket allow you to create a private repository for free.

PS: I would greatly appreciate it if you kindly give us some feedback about this code-challenge: how it was interesting, challengeable, clean, etc.
